# python-webapp
Template Python webapp using WebSockets and Flask

This is the basic structure needed to create a HTML and JS front-end, with a Python back-end, and communication with WebSocket.
- SocketIO is used as a websocket framework (gone are the days that I do everything manually...)
- Flask Werkzeug is used ot serve webpages (I know, I know. I just couldn't get the server threading to work with eventlet or gevent)

It is designed to be used as a starting point for a new Python based webapp.
